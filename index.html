  <p>We are all now connected by the internet’-Stephen Hawking. What does the future hold for humankind? </p>

  <p>The internet. A network providing information for the globe. It is a network that everybody needs. And it is entertainment for our generation. We, humans, are practically connected to it. But what would happen in the future, would the internet be attached to us. Let’s talk about the pros and cons of this topic. </p>

  <p>The internet can give us many things. Example, news, entertainment, shopping sites and a lot more. But the internet can also give us more danger than benefits. In this paragraph, I will talk about the pros of the future for humankind. The internet will not just be in our devices, it will also be in our transportations, vehicles, and any electronics around the house. There are lots of people using the internet in our world. To be precise, 49 percent of people in the world are using the internet. But soon, the internet will be more exposed in the future and 90 percent of the world will probably be exposed to the internet. The internet will have more security for your account in the future. Example, our future security system can protect us from hackers and viruses. One thing you have to keep in mind is that you have to install the application yourself to have such protection. </p>

  <p>The internet is already pretty interesting but in the future, the internet will have its own world. It is predicted that in the further future, the internet will have its own cyber world. Humans would wake up and will choose to either go outside and have a good time or stay home wearing a pair of glasses that transport you to the cyber world. The cyber world will either be you bringing the cyber world to the real world, AR. Or you being brought inside the cyber world, VR. An example of the AR version of the cyber world is that you can meet up with your friends without them being there. Both of you could be in different countries but still be sitting next to each other in a cafe. Or you can scan a certain object around your surroundings and the information will pop out. These are just a few examples. Example of the VR version of the cyber world is like you playing a video game. An example of this is you being able to have your own universe and talk to your friends there. Or you could create your own friend with intelligence in the cyber world. You could even start your own war in your own cyber world or join other peoples cyber world.</p>

  <p>But for all of these pros on the future of the internet, there are also cons. Example, I’ve already talked about the protection of the internet but it is different from the privacy of the internet. In the future, the internet will be controlled by the government. Which means doing anything wrong or searching anything illegal means jail or worse. Some programs from our generation might not stay forever but there is one which will stay till the end. The Dark Web. First of all, let me explain the meaning of the Dark Web. The Dark Web is a place where you can only access through a certain software. It is a website where anything illegal will be normal and death for people who use it will be common. The Dark Web is already pretty dangerous in our generation. But in the future, it might immediately affect anybody who steps in. If you are lured into the dark web by a person, your protection applications and system will not be able to help you. </p>

  <p>In conclusion, the future will grant us amazing things from the internet but there will also be some dangerous sides of the internet that you have to be cautious about in the future. </p>
